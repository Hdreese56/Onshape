# Onshape

## Part 1 - Base
### Reflection
This was a really simple project but a great intro to this new software. This assignment really took me back to 8th grade when we originally made this.

## Part 3 - Fork
### Reflection
This assignment is what puts onshape ahead of solid works for me, the shear simplicity and ease onshape makes this assignment is amazing.

## Part 5 - Wheel
### Reflection
The fillets on this software are out of this world and I am so shocked this is a web browser application.

## Part 8 - Bearing 1
### Reflection
Really simple part, similar to Collar it demonstrates how we can make a part with the geometry of another part.

## Sub assembly
### Reflection
The shear simplicity of onshape and how the logic of the program works is crazy.

## Final assembly
### Reflection
Probably the fastest I have ever finished a set of assignments but it was a great intro and I really like the program.

## Week Five Challenge

### Reflection
This was a struggle. I Breezed throught the first two parts and hit a major roadblock on the last part and the assembly. The mates for the assembly was super hard. But know I know how to use cylindrical mates.
